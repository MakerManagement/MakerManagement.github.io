The Project
====================

We the students will develop an inventory and loan system for Ã˜stold University College's MakerSpace. The purpose of this is to make it easier for employees at MakerSpace to keep track of inventory at all times. A full inventory system will help both students and staff to find equipment when a student assistant or department Engineer is not available. The system should preferably be able to know where equipment is in MakerSpace at any time. Simultaneously our employers want to have a system for users of the MakerSpace to be able to load the equipment in the MakerSpace.
